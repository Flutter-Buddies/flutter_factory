# flutter_factory

This is old project of mine I want to share and hopefully improve, game is mostly drawn with custom painters and since game started before any game engine for flutter it has its own `engine`.

Game is build at close to assembly line game for android. 
You can build factories and choose multiple different recipes to make. Your job is to somehow fit the assembly line for some product on as small place as you can.

Game has almost all features of original assembly line game with few new equipment.

[] Update to null-safety
[] Break huge providers into smaller ones
[] Move from provider to riverpod?
